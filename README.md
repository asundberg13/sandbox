# sandbox
This is just basic information about my readme file

@asundberg13 I cloned your sandbox repository, and I'm editing your README only to test out collaboration.
I went to github, looked at your repositories, and click the 'clone' button on one that didn't look too important.
From the dropdown on the 'clone' button, I copied the url.
From inside vs code, I used the command palette to clone from url.
I'm now editing that clone.

When I went to commit, I was reminded that I'm still on your copy and didn't have permission to push to your github.
I was prompted to fork, and I did.
I'll create a pull request next.
